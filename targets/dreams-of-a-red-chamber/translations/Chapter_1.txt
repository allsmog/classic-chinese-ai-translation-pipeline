This is the first chapter of the book, in which the author states: After experiencing a series of dreams and illusions, I decided to hide the truth and use the concept of spiritual communication to write this book, "The Story of the Stone". Hence, the character Zhen Shi Yin is introduced. But what and who does the book record? The author continues: Now, in the hustle and bustle of life, I have accomplished nothing. Suddenly, I think of all the women I have known, and upon careful reflection, I realize that their actions and insights surpass my own. How can I, a man of stature, not be inferior to them? I am filled with shame, but regret is of no use. On such a day, I wish to record my past, when I relied on the grace of heaven and the virtue of my ancestors, when I was clothed in silk and satin, when I enjoyed the finest food, when I turned my back on the teachings of my father and brothers, and when I failed to live up to the expectations of my teachers and friends. Now, I have no skills and have wasted half my life. I compile this collection to tell the world: I am indeed guilty, but there are many people in the boudoir who should not be forgotten because of my unworthiness. Even though I live in a humble house with a thatched roof, a clay stove, and a rope bed, the morning and evening dew, the willows in the courtyard, and the flowers in the garden do not hinder my writing. Even though I am uneducated and cannot write well, what's wrong with using colloquial language to tell a story? It can also make the boudoir known, please the eyes of the world, and break the melancholy of people, isn't it appropriate? Hence, the character Jia Yu Cun is introduced. In this chapter, the use of words like "dream" and "illusion" is to remind readers and also to establish the purpose of this book. 

You may ask, where does this book come from? The origin may seem absurd, but upon closer examination, it is quite interesting. Let me clarify its history so that readers will not be confused. When the goddess Nüwa was mending the sky with stones, she refined a stone from the Great Wilderness Mountain, which was twelve feet high and twenty-four feet square. There were 36,501 pieces of stubborn stone. Nüwa used only 36,500 pieces and left one piece unused, which was discarded at the foot of the Green Ridge Peak of this mountain. After being refined, this stone became spiritually aware. Seeing that all the other stones were used to mend the sky, it felt inferior and lamented day and night. One day, while it was mourning, it saw a monk and a Taoist coming from afar. They were extraordinary in appearance and demeanor, and they were talking and laughing. They first talked about the mysterious and fantastical stories of gods and immortals, and then they talked about the wealth and honor in the world. The stone was moved by their words and wanted to enjoy the wealth and honor in the human world. However, it was aware of its own crudeness. Therefore, it spoke human language and said to the monk and the Taoist: "Great masters, I am a crude object and cannot pay my respects. I heard you talking about the glory and prosperity of the human world, and I am eager to experience it. Although I am crude, I am somewhat spiritually aware. Seeing that you two are not ordinary people, you must have the ability to mend the sky and benefit the world, and the virtue to benefit others. If you could show a little mercy and take me to the human world, let me enjoy a few years in the place of wealth and gentleness, I will be forever grateful and will never forget your kindness." The two masters laughed and said, "Good, good! There are indeed some pleasures in the world, but they cannot be relied on forever. Moreover, there are imperfections in beauty, and good things often bring trouble. In a blink of an eye, joy can turn into sorrow, and people and things can change. In the end, everything is but a dream, and all realms return to emptiness. It's better not to go." The stone, however, was already eager to go and did not listen to their words. It pleaded again and again. The two masters knew that they could not force it, so they sighed and said, "This is the result of extreme quietness and extreme agitation, and the number of things that come from nothing. Since this is the case, we will take you to enjoy it. But when you are not satisfied, don't regret it." The stone said, "Of course, of course." The monk then said, "If you say you are spiritually aware, but you are so crude and have no special qualities, then you can only stand on your toes. Well, I will now use the great power of Buddhism to help you. When the calamity is over, you will return to your original nature and this case will be closed. What do you think?" The stone was grateful. The monk then chanted a spell, wrote a talisman, and used great magic to transform the large stone into a piece of bright and clean jade, which was reduced to the size of a fan pendant that could be worn or held. The monk held it in his hand and laughed, "The shape is indeed a treasure! But it still lacks real benefits. It needs to be engraved with some characters so that people can see at a glance that it is a rare object. Then we will take you to a prosperous country, a family of poetry and etiquette, a place of flourishing flowers and willows, a town of gentleness and wealth, where you can settle down and enjoy life." The stone was so happy that it couldn't help asking, "I don't know what special qualities you have given me, and I don't know where you are taking me. Please tell me so that I won't be confused." The monk laughed and said, "Don't ask, you will understand in the future." Then he put the stone in his sleeve, and he and the Taoist floated away, not knowing where they were going. 

Later, after who knows how many lifetimes and calamities, a Taoist named Kong Kong happened to pass by the Green Ridge Peak of the Great Wilderness Mountain. He saw a large stone with clear inscriptions and detailed records. Kong Kong read it from the beginning and found that it was a story about a stone that was not used to mend the sky, transformed into a human form, was taken into the world by a vague great master and a distant true person, and experienced all the ups and downs of life. There was also a poem at the end, which said: "No material can be used to mend the sky, and I have been in the world for so many years. This is the story of my past and future life, who will record it and make it a strange tale?" After the poem, there was a record of where the stone fell, where it was reincarnated, and the story of its personal experiences. The family and boudoir trivia, as well as the casual poems, were all complete, which might be interesting and relieve boredom. However, the dynasty and age, and the geography and country, were lost and untraceable. Kong Kong then said to the stone, "Brother Stone, according to your own words, this story of yours is somewhat interesting, so you recorded it here, intending to make it a legendary tale. But in my opinion, first, there is no dynasty or age to refer to, and second, there are no great virtues or great loyalty to govern the court and rectify customs. All it records are a few unusual women, either emotional or foolish, or slightly talented and kind, but none of them have the virtues of Ban Gu and Cai Nu. Even if I copy it, I'm afraid people won't like to read it."

The Stone laughed and replied, "Why is my master so foolish? If you say there is no dynasty to consider, then why not just embellish it with the chronicles of the Han and Tang dynasties? But I think, all the unofficial histories of the past have followed the same pattern. It would be more novel and unique if I don't borrow from them. I only need to focus on the facts and the logic of the events, why should I be constrained by the chronicles of the dynasties? Moreover, common people in the market rarely enjoy reading books about governance, but they love leisurely and interesting stories. Unofficial histories often slander the king and his ministers, or belittle women, filled with treachery and evil, too numerous to count. There is also a kind of romantic writing, which is obscene and stinky, harmful to people's morals, also too numerous to count. As for books about talented men and beautiful women, they all follow the same pattern, and they inevitably involve in licentiousness, full of Pan An, Zi Jian, Xi Shi, Wen Jun, but the authors just want to write their own couplets of love poems. Therefore, they have to create a man and a woman, and there must be a villain to stir up trouble, just like the clown in the drama. And when the maidservants open their mouths, they either talk about literature or reason. If you look at them one by one, they all contradict each other, and the stories that are far from reality are not as good as the few women I have seen and heard in half of my life. Although I dare not say that they are stronger than those in the books of the previous dynasties, their deeds and origins can also relieve boredom, and there are also a few crooked poems and familiar words that can be used to accompany meals and drinks. As for the joys and sorrows, ups and downs, I follow the traces and dare not add any fabrication, just for the sake of people's eyes, but I lose the truth. Nowadays, the poor are burdened by clothing and food every day, and the rich are always unsatisfied. Even if they have a little leisure time, they are also troubled by lust and greed. Where can they have time to read books about governance? Therefore, I don't want people to praise this story as wonderful, nor do I necessarily want people to enjoy reading it. I just hope that when they are drunk and full, or when they want to escape from the world and relieve their worries, they can play with this, isn't it a way to save some life and energy? Compared with the pursuit of vanity and delusion, it also saves the harm of gossip and the hustle and bustle of legs and feet. Moreover, it also allows people to change their old views, unlike those who pull and drag, suddenly leave and suddenly meet, full of talented men and beautiful women, Zi Jian, Wen Jun, Hong Niang, Xiao Yu and other familiar patterns of old drafts. What does my master think?" The Taoist monk Kong Kong listened to this, thought for a while, and then read the "Stone Record" again. Because he saw that although there were some words on it that pointed out the treachery and blamed the evil, it was not the purpose of hurting the world and scolding the world. As for the places related to the benevolence, loyalty, fatherly kindness, and filial piety, they all praised the merits and virtues, and they were endless, which was incomparable to other books. Although the main theme of the discussion is nothing more than recording the facts, it is not a false claim, a purely licentious invitation, and a private agreement, which is comparable to a stolen alliance. Because it does not interfere with the times, it is transcribed from beginning to end and returned to the world. From then on, the Taoist monk Kong Kong saw the color because of the emptiness, and the love was born from the color. From the color to the emptiness, he changed his name to the monk of love, and changed the "Stone Record" to the "Monk of Love Record". Dong Lu Kong Mei Xi then titled it "Mirror of Wind and Moon". Later, because Cao Xueqin read it in the Mourning Red Pavilion for ten years, revised it five times, compiled a catalog, divided it into chapters, and then titled it "Twelve Hairpins of Jinling", and titled a poem: Full of absurd words, a handful of bitter tears! Everyone says that the author is stupid, who can understand the taste? When it comes out, it is clear, let's see what story is on the stone. According to the book on the stone: On that day, the earth collapsed in the southeast, and there was a place in the southeast corner called Gusu, and there was a city called Changmen, which was the first and second place of wealth and elegance in the world. Outside this Changmen, there is a ten-mile street, and there is a Renqing Lane in the street. There is an ancient temple in the lane. Because the place is narrow, people call it the Gourd Temple. There is a local official living next to the temple. His surname is Zhen, his name is Fei, and his word is Shi Yin. His wife is Mrs. Feng, who is virtuous and deeply understands etiquette. Although the family is not very rich, the locals also regard him as a prestigious family. Because Zhen Shi Yin is naturally calm and does not think about fame and fortune, he enjoys watching flowers and bamboo, drinking wine and chanting poems every day, which is a kind of fairy-like character. The only thing is that he is now half a hundred years old, and he has no son under his knees. He only has a daughter, whose milk name is called Yinglian, who is only three years old. One day, in the long daylight of midsummer, Shi Yin was sitting idle in the study. When he was tired, he threw the book away, leaned on the table for a while, and fell asleep unknowingly. He dreamed of a place, but he didn't know where it was. Suddenly, a monk and a Taoist came from there, talking as they walked. The Taoist asked, "Where are you going with this stupid thing?" The monk laughed and said, "Don't worry, now there is a romantic case that should be settled. These romantic wronged souls have not yet been reincarnated. Take this opportunity to bring this stupid thing with them and let him experience it." The Taoist said, "So the romantic wronged souls are going to make a disaster in the world again? But I don't know where they will fall?" The monk laughed and said, "This is a funny thing to say, it's a rare thing that has never been heard before. Just because there is a plant of Jiaozhu grass on the bank of the Linghe River in the west, there is a red spot palace god Ying servant, who waters it with sweet dew every day, so that the Jiaozhu grass can survive for a long time. Later, after receiving the essence of heaven and earth, and being nourished by rain and dew, it was able to get rid of the grass and wood and change into a human form, only to become a female body, wandering outside the sky of separation all day long, eating honey and green fruits when hungry, and drinking the water of the sea of sorrow when thirsty. Just because the favor of watering has not been repaid, so its five internal organs are filled with a lingering feeling. Recently, this god Ying servant's worldly heart has been ignited, and he wants to go down to the world to create a history of illusion. He has already hung up his number in front of the fairy of Jinghuan. Jinghuan also asked him, the favor of watering has not been repaid, and it can be settled by this opportunity. The fairy of Jiaozhu said, "He is the favor of sweet dew, and I don't have this water to return to him. Since he is going to be a human being, I will also go to be a human being. But I will return all the tears of my life to him, and I can repay him." Because of this, many romantic wronged souls were hooked out to accompany them to settle this case. The Taoist said, "It's really unheard of. I've never heard of the saying of returning tears. I think this story is even more trivial and delicate than the romantic incidents of the past." The monk said, "The few romantic characters in the past just passed on the general idea and the chapters of poetry and prose, and never described the food and drink in the family boudoir. Moreover, most of the romantic stories are just stealing fragrance and jade, secret appointments and elopement, and they have never revealed the true feelings of men and women. I think these people will be different from the people who have been passed down in the world when they enter the world." The Taoist said, "Why don't you and I also go down to the world to save a few people, isn't it a great merit?" The monk said, "It's exactly what I mean. You go with me to the palace of the fairy of Jinghuan, and clear up the stupid things. After these romantic wronged souls have finished their reincarnation, you and I will go again. Although half of them have fallen into the dust now, they are not all gathered yet." The Taoist said, "If that's the case, I'll go with you." But Zhen Shi Yin heard it clearly, but he didn't know what the stupid thing was. So he couldn't help but step forward to salute and laugh and ask, "Two immortals, please." The monk also hurriedly returned the salute and asked. Shi Yin then said, "I just heard the immortals talking about cause and effect, which is really rare in the world. But I am stupid and can't understand it clearly. If the immortals can open up my stupidity and tell me in detail, I will listen carefully and be slightly alert, so that I can avoid the suffering of sinking into the world."

The monk and the Taoist priest hurriedly returned the greeting. Shi Yin then said, "I just heard the immortal master discussing karma, which is rarely heard in the world. However, I, as a disciple, am ignorant and cannot fully understand it. If you could enlighten me, I would listen attentively and perhaps be able to avoid the suffering of worldly entanglements." The two immortals laughed and said, "This is a profound mystery that cannot be revealed prematurely. When the time comes, do not forget us two, and you will be able to escape from the pit of fire." Shi Yin, upon hearing this, did not ask further. He laughed and said, "The profound mystery cannot be revealed prematurely, but you just mentioned a stupid object. I don't know what it is, can I see it?" The monk said, "If you ask about this object, there is indeed a connection." As he spoke, he took out a piece of bright and beautiful jade and handed it to Shi Yin. When Shi Yin took it, he saw that it was engraved with the words "Tong Ling Bao Yu" (The Precious Jade of Spiritual Understanding), and there were a few lines of small characters on the back. Just as he was about to look closely, the monk said they had arrived at the illusionary realm, forcibly took the jade from his hand, and passed a large stone archway with the Taoist priest. The archway was inscribed with four large characters, "Tai Xu Huan Jing" (The Illusionary Realm of the Great Void). On both sides, there was a couplet that read: "When the false becomes real, the real also becomes false; where there is nothing, there is still something." Shi Yin wanted to follow them, but as he was about to step forward, he suddenly heard a loud thunderclap, as if the mountains were collapsing and the earth was sinking. Shi Yin shouted out, and when he looked again, he saw the scorching sun and the rustling banana leaves. He had forgotten most of his dream. He then saw his wet nurse carrying his daughter Ying Lian towards him. Shi Yin saw that his daughter was becoming more and more beautiful and adorable, so he reached out to take her, held her in his arms, played with her for a while, and then took her to the street to watch the bustling festival. Just as he was about to go in, he saw a monk and a Taoist priest coming from the other side: the monk was a leper and barefoot, and the Taoist priest was lame and unkempt, both were acting crazy, talking and laughing as they approached. When they arrived at his door and saw Shi Yin holding Ying Lian, the monk began to cry and said to Shi Yin, "Benefactor, why are you holding this ill-fated object that will bring misfortune to its parents?" Shi Yin heard this and knew it was nonsense, so he ignored him. The monk continued to say, "Let me go, let me go!" Shi Yin, impatient, was about to take his daughter inside when the monk pointed at him and laughed, reciting four lines of verse: "You foolishly pamper and spoil her, while she vainly gazes at her own reflection. Beware of the time after the Lantern Festival, for then it will be time for smoke to vanish and fire to extinguish." Shi Yin heard this clearly and hesitated, wanting to ask them about their origins. But he heard the Taoist priest say, "You and I need not travel together. Let's part here and go about our own business. After three calamities, I will wait for you on Mount Beimang, and we will go together to the Illusionary Realm of the Great Void to dissolve our identities." The monk said, "Excellent, excellent!" After saying this, the two of them left and were nowhere to be seen. Shi Yin thought to himself at this time: These two people must have a story, I should have asked them. Now it's too late to regret. As Shi Yin was lost in thought, he saw a poor scholar named Jia Hua, also known as Yu Xing, who was living in the gourd temple next door. Jia Yu Cun was originally from Hu Zhou, a family of scholars and officials. However, he was born in the late period, his family's foundation had been exhausted, and his family had declined, leaving only him. He had no benefits in his hometown, so he came to the capital to seek fame and fortune, and to rebuild his family's foundation. Since he came here last year, he has been stranded and temporarily living in the temple for shelter. Every day he sells his writings to make a living, so Shi Yin often interacts with him. At this moment, Yu Cun saw Shi Yin and hurriedly greeted him with a smile, "Old sir, are you standing at the door because there is some news in the market?" Shi Yin laughed and said, "No, I just brought my daughter out to play because she was crying. It's really boring. It's great that you're here. Please come to my study for a chat, it will help us both pass the time." After saying this, he ordered someone to take his daughter inside, and he and Yu Cun walked hand in hand to the study. After the tea was served and they had chatted for a while, a servant rushed in to report: "Master Yan has come to visit." Shi Yin hurriedly got up and apologized, "Please forgive me for not being able to accompany you. Please wait a moment, I will be right back." Yu Cun also got up and said, "Old sir, please go ahead. I am a frequent visitor, there's no need to worry about me." After saying this, Shi Yin had already left for the front hall. Here, Yu Cun was flipping through books to pass the time. Suddenly, he heard a woman's cough outside the window. Yu Cun got up and looked out the window, and saw a maid picking flowers. She was not ordinary in appearance, with clear eyebrows and eyes. Although she was not extremely beautiful, she had a charming quality. Yu Cun couldn't help but stare. The maid of the Zhen family had picked the flowers and was about to leave when she suddenly looked up and saw a man in the window. He was dressed in ragged clothes, but he was robust, with a broad face and square mouth. Although he was poor, he had a heroic appearance with sword-like eyebrows, starry eyes, a straight nose, and prominent cheekbones. The maid quickly turned around to avoid him, thinking to herself: This man looks so strong, yet so ragged. I think he must be the Jia Yu Cun that my master often talks about. He always wanted to help him, but never had the opportunity. Our family doesn't have any relatives who are so poor, so it must be him. It's strange that he also said that he is not a person who will be trapped for long. Thinking this, she couldn't help but look back at him twice. Yu Cun saw her look back and thought that this woman must be interested in him, so he was overjoyed. He thought that this woman must be a discerning heroine, a confidante in the world of mortals. Just then, a servant came in, and Yu Cun learned that he was being invited to dinner in the front hall, so he left through the side door. After Shi Yin's guests had left and he knew that Yu Cun had left on his own, he didn't go to invite him again. The next day, it was the Mid-Autumn Festival. After Shi Yin's family banquet was over, he prepared another feast in the study, and then walked to the temple to invite Yu Cun. It turned out that Yu Cun had seen the maid of the Zhen family look back at him twice that day, and he thought she was a confidante, so he always kept her in his mind. Today was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and he couldn't help but feel melancholic as he looked at the moon. He recited a five-character quatrain: "I have not yet made my three wishes, but I have added another layer of sorrow. When I am sad, I furrow my brow, and how many times have I turned my head when I leave? I see my shadow in the wind, who can be my companion under the moon? If the moonlight has any intention, it should first shine on the jade person's tower." After reciting the poem, Yu Cun thought about his lifelong ambition, which had not yet been realized due to the lack of opportunity. He scratched his head, sighed deeply, and recited another couplet: "Jade is in the ginger, waiting for a good price; the hairpin is in the box, waiting for the right time to fly." Just as Shi Yin arrived, he heard this and laughed, "Brother Yu Cun, you really have great ambitions!" Yu Cun laughed and said, "I'm just casually reciting someone else's poem, how dare I be so presumptuous." He then asked, "Why is the old sir here?" Shi Yin laughed and said, "Tonight is the Mid-Autumn Festival, commonly known as the reunion festival. I thought that you, living in the monk's room, might feel lonely, so I prepared a small drink and invited you to my study for a drink. I don't know if you can accept my invitation?" Yu Cun heard this and did not refuse. He laughed and said, "Since I have received such a generous invitation, how can I refuse such a great kindness?"

The text translates to:

Someone asked, "Old gentleman, what brings you here?" Shi Yuan laughed and said, "Tonight is the Mid-Autumn Festival, commonly known as the Festival of Reunion. I imagine you, my esteemed brother, must feel somewhat lonely staying in the monks' quarters. Therefore, I have prepared a small drink and invite you to my humble abode for a drink. I wonder if you would accept my invitation?" Upon hearing this, Yu Cun did not refuse and laughed, "Since I am so kindly invited, how could I refuse such generosity?" With that, he accompanied Shi Yuan back to the study. After a while, the tea was finished and the table was already set with food and fine wine. The two of them sat down, first sipping slowly, then gradually engaging in deep conversation. Unconsciously, they drank to their heart's content. At that time, every household in the neighborhood was filled with music and song, and a bright moon hung overhead, adding to their high spirits. By this time, Yu Cun was quite drunk and, unable to contain his excitement, he composed a poem to the moon: "When the moon is full, it is a time of reunion. Its bright light protects the jade railing. The moon in the sky is just rising, and all the people on earth look up to see it." Shi Yuan heard this and exclaimed, "Wonderful! I always knew you were not meant to remain unknown. The verses you just recited show signs of soaring ambition. Soon, you will be able to step on the clouds. Congratulations, congratulations!" He then personally poured a large cup of wine to celebrate. After drinking it, Yu Cun sighed, "I am not just boasting while drunk. If we talk about the current trends in learning, I might be able to make a name for myself. However, I have no money for travel expenses to the capital, and the journey is long. I cannot rely solely on selling my writings to get there." Before he could finish, Shi Yuan said, "Why didn't you say so earlier? I have always wanted to help you, but every time we met, you never mentioned it, so I didn't dare to presume. Now that you have, although I am not talented, I still understand the concepts of righteousness and profit. Fortunately, next year is the year of the imperial examination. You should hurry to the capital and try your luck. As for the expenses and other matters, I will take care of them for you. This way, your talents will not be wasted!" He immediately ordered a servant to bring fifty taels of silver and two sets of winter clothes. He also said, "The 19th is an auspicious day. You can buy a boat and head west. We can meet again next winter after you have achieved great success. Wouldn't that be wonderful?" Yu Cun accepted the silver and clothes, thanked him briefly, and continued to drink and chat. It was not until the third watch of the night that the two of them parted. After sending Yu Cun off, Shi Yuan returned to his room and slept until the sun was three poles high. Thinking about the events of the previous night, he wanted to write two more recommendation letters for Yu Cun to take to the capital, so that Yu Cun could find a place to stay in the house of a government official. However, when he sent someone to invite Yu Cun, the servant returned and said, "The monk said that Master Jia left for the capital at the fifth watch today. He also left a message for the old master, saying that scholars do not care about auspicious or inauspicious days, but only about reason and principle. He did not have time to say goodbye in person." Upon hearing this, Shi Yuan could only let it go. Time flies when one is idle, and before he knew it, it was the Lantern Festival again. Shi Yuan ordered his servant Huo Qi to take his daughter Yinglian to watch the lanterns and fireworks. In the middle of the night, Huo Qi needed to relieve himself, so he left Yinglian sitting on the doorstep of a house while he went. When he returned, Yinglian was nowhere to be found. Huo Qi searched for her all night until dawn, but found no trace of her. Fearing his master's wrath, he fled to another place. When Shi Yuan and his wife realized that their daughter had not returned all night, they knew something was wrong. They sent several people to search for her, but all returned with no news. The couple, who had only this daughter in half a lifetime, were devastated by her loss. They cried day and night, almost wanting to die. After a month, Shi Yuan fell ill. At the same time, his wife, Madame Feng, also fell ill due to worry about their daughter. They sought medical treatment daily, but to no avail. On the fifteenth of the third month, there was a festival at the Hulugou Temple. The monks were careless while frying offerings, causing the oil pot to catch fire and ignite the window paper. Most of the houses in this area were made of bamboo and wood, and due to fate, the fire spread from one house to another, burning an entire street like a mountain of flames. Although soldiers and civilians came to help, the fire was too fierce to be extinguished. It burned all night before gradually dying out. No one knew how many houses were burned. The Zhen family, who lived next door, had their house burned to the ground. Only the lives of the couple and a few servants were spared. Shi Yuan could only stamp his feet and sigh. He discussed with his wife and decided to move to their farm for safety. However, in recent years, due to drought and flood, bandits were rampant, robbing lands and stealing crops. The people could not live in peace. As a result, the government sent troops to suppress the bandits, making it difficult for Shi Yuan to settle down. He had no choice but to sell his farm and take his wife and two maids to his father-in-law's house. His father-in-law, Feng Su, was a native of Daruzhou. Although he was a farmer, his family was quite well-off. Seeing his son-in-law in such a sorry state, he was somewhat displeased. Fortunately, Shi Yuan still had some money left from selling his farm. He gave it to Feng Su and asked him to buy some land and houses at a reasonable price for their future livelihood. Feng Su half-coaxed and half-cheated him, giving him some poor land and dilapidated houses. Shi Yuan, being a scholar, was not used to farming and other such work. He struggled for a year or two, but found himself getting poorer. Every time Feng Su saw him, he would make some sarcastic remarks, complaining that they were not good at living and only knew how to eat and be lazy. Shi Yuan knew that he was not welcome and regretted his decision. Moreover, he had been traumatized by the events of the previous year and was filled with anger and grief. As an old man, he was attacked by poverty and illness, and gradually showed signs of nearing death. One day, he hobbled to the street to distract himself and saw a lame Taoist coming from the other side. The Taoist was crazy and disheveled, wearing hemp shoes and a quail coat. He was chanting a few words: "Everyone knows that immortality is good, but they can't forget about fame and fortune! Where are the generals and ministers of the past? Their graves are covered with grass. Everyone knows that immortality is good, but they can't forget about gold and silver! All day long they regret not having enough, and when they have a lot, their eyes close. Everyone knows that immortality is good, but they can't forget about their beautiful wives! When they are alive, they talk about love every day, but when they die, they follow others. Everyone knows that immortality is good, but they can't forget about their children and grandchildren! There have been many foolish parents since ancient times, but who has seen filial children and grandchildren?" Shi Yuan heard this and approached him, asking, "What are you saying? I only heard 'good' and 'over'." The Taoist laughed, "If you heard the words 'good' and 'over', then you are quite enlightened. You should know that in this world, everything is good when it's over, and it's over when it's good. If it's not over, it's not good. If you want it to be good, it has to be over. This song of mine is called 'The Song of Good and Over'." Shi Yuan, being a wise man, understood the meaning of his words as soon as he heard them. He laughed and said, "Wait! Let me interpret your 'Song of Good and Over'. How about that?" The Taoist laughed, "You interpret, you interpret."

Shi Yin then said: "In a humble room and empty hall, once filled with ivory tablets, now only withered grass and dead poplars remain, once a stage for song and dance. Spider webs cover the carved beams, green gauze now pasted on the broken windows. What use is thick rouge and fragrant powder when frost forms on one's temples? Yesterday, white bones were sent off on the yellow earth ridge, tonight, mandarin ducks lie under the red lantern. Gold and silver fill the box, but in the blink of an eye, beggars are everywhere, slandered by all. While lamenting others' short lives, who knew one would return in mourning? Discipline may be sound, but who can guarantee that one won't become a strong beam in the future? Choosing the finest food and drink, who would expect to end up in a brothel? Because of a small official hat, one ends up in shackles. Yesterday, pitying the cold in a torn jacket, today, despising the length of a purple python robe. In the chaos, you finish singing and I take the stage, recognizing a foreign place as home. How absurd, in the end, we are all making wedding clothes for others!" 

Upon hearing this, the mad and lame Taoist clapped his hands and laughed, saying, "Well understood, well understood!" Shi Yin then said, "Let's go!" He snatched the Taoist's shoulder bag, did not return home, and left with the mad Taoist. This caused a stir in the neighborhood, and everyone treated it as a piece of news. 

When Feng's family heard this, they were devastated. They had no choice but to discuss with their father and send people to search everywhere, but there was no news. Helplessly, they had to rely on their parents to get by. Fortunately, there were still two maids from the old days to serve them. The three of them, master and servants, made some needlework to sell day and night to help their father with expenses. Although Feng Su complained every day, there was nothing he could do. 

One day, the Zhen family's maid was buying thread at the door, when she suddenly heard a shout from the street. Everyone said that the new official had arrived. The maid hid in the door and watched. She saw soldiers and fast hands, one pair after another, and then a large sedan chair carrying an official in a black hat and red robe passed by. The maid was startled and thought to herself that the official had a kind face and seemed familiar. She then entered the room and put it out of her mind. 

In the evening, just as they were about to rest, they suddenly heard a loud knock on the door and a lot of people shouting, "The master of this house has sent someone to summon someone for questioning." When Feng Su heard this, he was so scared that he was dumbfounded, not knowing what disaster had befallen them.
